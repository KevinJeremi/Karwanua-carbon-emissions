# Backup Files - Created Before Vercel Deployment

**Date Created:** October 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Safety backup of critical files before deploying to Vercel

## Files Backed Up

### 1. `ai-analytics-summary-route.ts.backup`
- **Original Path:** `src/app/api/ai/analytics-summary/route.ts`
- **Description:** Critical AI-powered analytics endpoint using Groq API
- **Why Important:** 
  - Contains the main AI summary generation logic
  - Uses GROQ_API_KEY environment variable
  - Has fallback responses for error handling
  - Core functionality for analytics dashboard

## How to Restore

If you need to restore any file:

1. Copy the backup file
2. Remove the `.backup` extension
3. Place it back in its original path (see comments in each file)

## Notes

- These backups are excluded from git (check .gitignore)
- Keep this folder safe - do not delete
- Original files remain in their locations and are working
- This is just a safety measure before deployment

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `GROQ_API_KEY` - Required for AI analytics summary feature
